## üéµ How it works

The Electron application connects to your Discord client via RPC. Then, when you're listening to music, it will send updates to Discord so it can display it on your profile using Rich Presence.

## üìå Known problems

- When on the fullscreen player page, the application thinks you're switching music
- If you go on an other website than an Emby instance, the application will not work

## üì• Setup

First, install the dependencies required by the application, such as the Electron library. Use one of these commands in your terminal :

```bash
npm install  # if you use NPM

yarn install # if you use Yarn
```

Then, create a `config.json` file based on the `config.sample.json` file, and replace the `url` field with your Emby instance's URL.

## üíª Development

To run the application for development, use one of these commands :

```bash
npm start  # if you use NPM

yarn start # if you use Yarn
```

## üî® Build

If you want to have an executable file, build the application using one of these commands :

```bash
npm run build  # if you use NPM

yarn build     # if you use Yarn
```
